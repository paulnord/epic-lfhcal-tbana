# epic-lfhcal-tbana software repo

This software repo is meant to serve as basis for the test beam root based analysis of the LFHCal test beams and test beam setups.
The repo contains the initial code used in 2023 under OldStructure & the newer version of the code under NewStructure <br>

A detailed introduction to this package in particular the NewStructure can be found [here](https://friederikebock.gitbook.io/epiclfhcaltb-ana)
It is highly recommended to follow that guide.

Credit for the software development goes primarily to Vincent Andrieux (@vandrie), Tristan Protzman (@tlprotzman) and Friederike Bock (@FriederikeBock).

## Compilation
To build the software, we recommend using cMake.
1) Make sure you have the latest version of the decoder `git pull --recurse-submodules`.  If it is your first time using the submodule you should run `git submodule update --init --recursive`

Option 1:
2) Set up the compilation in the same directory.  From the `NewStructure` folder, run `cmake .`
3) Compile the code with `make`

Option 2:
2) Set up a dedicated build directory.  From the `NewStructure` folder, run `cmake -B build .`
3) Compile the code.  Switch to the build directory with `cd build` and compile with `make`


For convenience a linker script is provided, which can be used to recreate the software structure with soft links. Execute it in the directory where you would like to work after having added your user name and path to the software repo

```console
bash $PATHTOSCRIPT/prepareAnalysisDirectory.sh $USERNAME [new/old]
```

In order to prevent ROOT from complaining about dictionaries of classes not found you must run `hadd` or `root` from *NewStructure*. This is because when root starts up it will read the "rootmap" file present in the current directory and load the libraries accordingly with the paths given. Since the paths in the "rootmap" file are relative to *NewStructure* it will only work there.

To generate doxygen documentation for the project in *NewStructure*, navigate to the *NewStructure* directory (`cd NewStructure`) and run `doxygen Doxyfile`. This will generate [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) style documentation for the project in a new folder called __doxy__ inside *NewStructure*. The Doxygen settings can be modified in a file called __Doxyfile__ found in *NewStructure*.

## Fetching TB2026 raw data

`tools/fetch-tb2026-raw` downloads selected `RunNNN.h2g` files from the
JLab XRootD store. Individual runs and inclusive ranges can be mixed:

```console
python3 tools/fetch-tb2026-raw \
  --destination /path/to/2026TBdata \
  137 138-149 153 159 165 178
```

New files are downloaded normally; existing partial files are resumed. See
[`docs/fetch-tb2026-raw.md`](docs/fetch-tb2026-raw.md) for dry runs, remote
listing, replacement behavior, and source configuration.

## Reproducible job launcher (experimental)

`tools/lfhcal-run` runs arbitrary analysis commands locally, in parallel, or
through HTCondor while recording execution provenance. Analysis-program options
remain entirely under the control of the program being run.

```console
# One local command
python3 tools/lfhcal-run -- ./NewStructure/HGCROCStudy [options ...]

# Several commands, four at a time
python3 tools/lfhcal-run -j 4 jobs.txt

# The same jobs through HTCondor (run on the submit host, outside eic-shell)
python3 tools/lfhcal-run --condor jobs.txt
```

See [`docs/lfhcal-run.md`](docs/lfhcal-run.md) for named multi-file lineage,
job-file syntax, provenance output, and Condor/container configuration.
